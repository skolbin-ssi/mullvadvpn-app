# Diagrams
The diagrams are written for [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). The SVG files can be produced via `plantuml -tsvg *.puml`.

The more complex diagrams require a version of PlantUML that uses [eclipses diagramming library](https://plantuml.com/elk),
this is indicated by the line `!pragma layout elk`.
